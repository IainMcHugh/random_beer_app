# Random Beer Generator!

An application that uses the BreweryDB API to generate random beers, as well as associated information about their Breweries.

## Project Brief

"You are to develop a very simple web app that consists of two screens. The main screen should display a random beer. You should be able to click on the beer's brewery name to view more information about that brewery. This screen should display more information about the selected beerâ€™s brewery - brewery name, description, label and start year. Only beers with a brewery should be displayed."

### Key Features

 - On initial load, displays a randomly generated beer (with name, label, and description).
 - Provides the user with a button to randomly generate a new beer. 
 - Routing to and from the Home page to a Details page which lists information about the current beer's brewery.
 - Session caching to allow for faster page transitions between routes, as well as minimising API requests.
 - API Key secured through use of environment variables.
 - Dynamic styling using **styled-components**, with consistent theming throughout the application.
 - Comprehensive unit testing of API requests using jest and the mws library
 - Consistent error handling with with simple snackbar implementation to highlight any active errors.
